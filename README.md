**Introducing BOB: A Robot for COGS 300 Class Competition**
=====================================================

### Project Overview

BOB is a robot designed to compete in the COGS 300 class competition. Our team used ML-Agents, a powerful AI tool for the Unity game engine, to program the robot to fight against opponents in a 2-minute game.

### Gameplay

The game is simple:

* Each opponent starts at opposite ends of the arena, with green balls in the center.
* The objective is to collect as many balls as possible in your starting area within the 2-minute time period.
* Robots can grab and steal balls, and shoot lasers at opponents to slow them down.

### Technical Details

The C# scripts for this project can be found in the `Assets/Resources/BOB` directory. We used Unity and ML-Agents to create the robot and program its behavior.

### About the Project
